Pandemic, crisis, growth year, this involves almost everything facing in this historic year.

As part of this, I want to remember the important things, the love for our relates, the concern about our kids, the fragile of our bodies.

I was happy this year, on home with family, trying to learning new things. One of this, the stock market. Behaviors, tredings, mathematics, models. The persuit for money, investment. I saw it's possible make economic freedom.

On other hand, the farm, gives peace and health.

Development still as my passion, I want to be a better developer.

Family, my heart, my motor, the impulse for every action I made.

Next 2021, the adventure continues, my hopes are on we'll live.

Thanks 2020.
