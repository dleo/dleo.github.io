Hello, I made this as a record through my adventures.

I want shared mostly on English because it's my way for practice the language, but of course you will find stuff on Spanish and perhaps some new language on this trip (Yes, I want learn another languages).

The idea is shared experiencies, knowlogment and cool stuffs about development, farming and some bitacoras.

Go ahead.
